This is a public repository for Callie's work for the MBIO 691 Class at UH MƒÅnoa. 

The file Project.ipynb is a python script that produces three firgures for the final project.

The folder data holds coral_forecast.csv, which contains the columns:

* **coral_cover_2020/2100**: Simulation estimates of tropical coral cover averaged across 2010-2020, and 2090-2100 respectively (km $^2$).
* **SST_2020/SST_2100**: Mean SST (sea-surface temperature) averaged across 2010-2020, and 2090-2100 respectively (degrees C).
* **SST_seasonal**: Amplitude of the seasonal SST cycle, i.e. difference between summer and winter SST (degrees C).
* **pH_2020/pH_2100**: Mean pH averaged across 2010-2020, and 2090-2100 respectively.
* **PAR**: Benthic Photosynthetically Available Radiation (mol m $^{-2}$ d $^{-1}$ ).
* **longitude/latitude**: Longitude/latitude of the site.
* **model**: Simulation configuration, numbered 0-11.

The folder figs holds .png versions of figures produced by the Project.ipynb script.
